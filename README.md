Description - 
               Traditional routing metrics designed for wireless networks are application agnostic. In the proposed system, consider a wireless network where the application flows consist of video traffic. From a user perspective, reducing the level of video distortion is critical. Popular link-quality-based routing metrics do not account for dependence across the links of a path as a result, it cause video flows to converge onto a few paths and thus cause high video distortion. To account for the evolution of the video frame loss process, an analytical framework has to be constructed first to understand and second assess the impact of the wireless network on video distortion. The framework allows to formulate a routing policy for minimizing distortion, based on which design a protocol for routing video traffic. To implement the proposed system via simulations and test bed experiments that our protocol is efficient in reducing video distortion and minimizing the user experience degradation.
